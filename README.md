1. You might like to read through [the workshop requirements](https://github.com/emanuil-tolev/es-hands-on-intro/blob/master/workshop-requirements.md) to make sure the software is running and configured correctly. `docker` and `docker-compose` will make your life much easier.
2. git clone https://github.com/emanuil-tolev/es-hands-on-intro.git

    or if you do not have git installed, download this link and unzip the resulting file into a folder https://github.com/emanuil-tolev/es-hands-on-intro/archive/master.zip
    
    Either way, this will create a new directory holding the contents of this repository.

4. enter into the new directory and run `docker-compose up`
5. Run `./build.sh`

    Alternatively, (e.g. if you're using Windows) run each line in the build.sh file as a separate command from inside the new directory.
